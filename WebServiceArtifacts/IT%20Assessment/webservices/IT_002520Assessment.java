/**
 * 
 * Description: Project: New Software System Implementation
 * Task:     IT Assessment
 * 
 * This component models the weekly costs and total duration associated with the IT Assessment project task.  The IT Assessment task will determine an IT Plan for the implementation of the prototype system and eventually the final system.  The IT Plan will address any required hardware and software changes or modifications, whether or not any existing systems will need to be temporarily taken down and the resulting impacts on existing operations, how the primary user group's current system and operations will be affected during the implementation, and any other issues that may arise during the implementation process.  This task will involve the Core Team and the IT Team.
 * 
 * Predecessor Task: Vendor Selection
 * Successor Task: Prototype Implementation
 * 
 * Note: All assumptions about the uncertainty of task durations and the percent of time that each team expects to spend on each task per week were determined by the Core Team.
 * 
 * 
 * This class was generated by the JAX-WS RI.
